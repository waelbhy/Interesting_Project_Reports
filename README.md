<b>DESCRIPTION</b> : This repository serves as an archive containing the final reports of some interesting projects that I worked on as a student. These are mainly PDF files, but some code and other necessary ressources have been included for those who would like to access them. The descriptions given in the ToC section do not go into details, but rather serve as TLDR descriptions. 

<b>TABLE OF CONTENTS</b> : <ul>
<li> GenerativeAdversarialNetworks : the end result of a project that served as an introduction to neural networks and GANs. This document dives into the underlying mechanisms behind GANs and showcases some results that we obtained on the MNIST and FASHION_MNIST datasets.</li>
<li> WineQualityAnalysisAndClassification : we were given a dataset containing 1600 wines with some variables measured on each one of them, as well as a column attributing them a sort of grade on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being very bad and 10 excellent). The purpose of this project was to determine what factors were responsible for making a wine <em>good</em> using statistical methods of our choice. We then compared multiple classification tools (CARTs, Random Forests, KNNs... ) and built a neural network in order to find the best classifier for this unbalanced dataset. </li>
<li> BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The goal was to select a newly released and fairly technical article, and to produce a 4 page summary of the topic. A strict template was imposed, and we also suggested an implementation of BERT for a multi-label classification use-case.</li>
</ul>
